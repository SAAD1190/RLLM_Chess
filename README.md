## Introduction

Chess has been a cornerstone in the development of artificial intelligence, serving as a benchmark for testing AI capabilities in strategic thinking and decision-making. The **Chess AI Project** aims to merge the strategic depth of chess with modern AI techniques, creating an AI opponent that can challenge players of varying skill levels.

This project leverages a neural network trained on extensive chess game data to predict and execute moves. The integration with Pygame ensures that users have a seamless and interactive experience, allowing them to focus on the game without being bogged down by technical complexities.

Whether you're a chess enthusiast eager to test your skills against an AI or a developer interested in the intersection of game development and machine learning, this project offers valuable insights and a robust platform for exploration.

### File and Directory Descriptions

- **`GUI.py`:**
  - Manages the graphical user interface.
  - Handles user interactions, rendering of the chessboard and pieces, move selection, and integration with the AI for move suggestions.
  
- **`board.py`:**
  - Maintains the game state using the `Board` and `Move` classes.
  - Handles move generation, validation, and state updates.
  - Manages special moves like castling, en passant, and promotion.
  
- **`predict_move.py`:**
  - Interfaces with the neural network model to predict the best moves based on the current board state.
  - Converts FEN strings to numerical feature vectors suitable for the neural network.
  
- **`utils.py`:**
  - Contains utility functions for converting between different representations.
  - Includes functions like `algebraic_to_square` and `square_to_algebraic` for handling move notations.
  
- **`minimax.py`:**
  - Implements the Minimax algorithm as a fallback for move suggestions if the neural network does not provide a move.
